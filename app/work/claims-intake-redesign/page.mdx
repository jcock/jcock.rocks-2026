<h1>Claims Intake Redesign</h1>

<p>
	This is an example work sample authored in <strong>MDX</strong> under{' '}
	<code>app/work/claims-intake-redesign/page.mdx</code>.
</p>

## Project Snapshot

- **Client:** ACME Insurance (fictional sample)
- **Timeline:** 8 weeks
- **Role:** Product Designer + Frontend Developer
- **Primary Goal:** Reduce abandonment on the first step of claim submission

## Problem

Users were dropping off before completing the first form section. Session replays
showed confusion around policy lookup, required fields, and error messaging.

## Approach

1. Audited the existing flow and mapped friction points.
2. Reworked field grouping and progressive disclosure.
3. Added clearer validation copy and inline formatting hints.
4. Introduced event tracking for step completion and error frequency.

## Result

- Step-1 completion increased from **61% to 79%**.
- Total time-to-submit decreased by **22%**.
- Support requests related to claim intake decreased by **31%**.

> Replace this sample with real screenshots, outcomes, and implementation notes.

```tsx
// Example: event tracking used in the redesigned flow
trackEvent('Engagement', 'Claims Intake Step Complete', 'Step 1');
```
