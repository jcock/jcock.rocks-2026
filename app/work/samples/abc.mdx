## Overview

Aloysius Butler & Clark (AB&C), one of the largest full-service independent marketing communications agencies in the mid-Atlantic, introduced an exciting agency rebrand and the launch of its new website. With dynamic new positioning, Never the same™, the AB&C brand and site embrace a story the agency has been writing for more than five decades—demonstrating the ways its structure, capabilities, growth and strategies offer both the stability and fluidity to exceed client expectations and deliver results.

## Strategy

We wanted to focus on helping new and prospective clients start or continue their journey to game-changing brand building, audience engagement, and content creation and placement. To do that, we needed to create a website that was as dynamic and engaging as the work AB&C produces for its clients. The new site had to be a destination for clients and prospects to learn about the agency’s capabilities, see case studies of work and results, and get to know the people behind the work.

## Success

The new website is highly interactive and content rich. It offers case studies, client testimonials and a delineation of services spanning the agency’s five business hubs—healthcare, behavior change, recruitment marketing, consumer and specialty B2B. Designed to be dynamic, fun and inviting, the site offers several key new features.
