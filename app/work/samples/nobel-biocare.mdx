## Overview

For six decades, Nobel Biocare sat comfortably atop the implant-based dental-restoration market they had pioneered. But after a series of missteps, including an inconsistent brand presence and some resting on laurels, they saw their market dominance erode.

## Strategy

We were asked to help reposition Nobel as the global leader in esthetic dentistry. Through close to 100 interviews with stakeholders in key markets, competitive analysis, and numerous manufacturing and lab visits, we uncovered what matters most to dentists, implant experts, labs and patients: The Assurance of Premium Quality.

The bold “Our Best Only” positioning and complete brand overhaul helped to rebuild confidence and brand trust within the international implant community. We updated every aspect of the brand, from the identity to product photography styling, with emphasis on revitalizing the brand voice, color and typography.

## Success

Response to our brand positioning workshop was overwhelming and secured alignment among 18 key internal stakeholders. A new identity was finalized. A complete website redesign was launched with the brand roll-out. The new branding has helped to recast Nobel Biocare—to both internal and external audiences—as the premium implant option in a marketplace overrun by discount brands.
