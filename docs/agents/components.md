# Components

- Consider breaking files into smaller components, especially if a component exceeds ~150 lines or has multiple responsibilities.
- Avoid duplicating code within the same file or across files; create reusable components or functions instead.
- Use descriptive names for components and files (e.g., `UserProfileCard` instead of `Card1`).
- Use kebab case for file names (e.g., `user-profile-card.js`).
